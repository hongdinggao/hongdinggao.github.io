I am an industrial postdoc from  

-  Aarhus University [AU](http://www.au.dk/en/)    
-  Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation [NAV](http://www.nordicebv.info)  

I mainly work on genetic evaluation and genomic selection on dairy cattle


I am originally from Beijing, but I am tired of the life in big city. That is the reason I live in Denmark now.

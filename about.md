I am an industrial postdoc from    
- Aarhus University [AU](http://www.au.dk/en/)    
- Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation [NAV](http://www.nordicebv.info/Forside.htm)  

I mainly work on genetic evaluation and genomic selection on dairy cattle, you can find my university homepage [here](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id/(9eb94cac-b972-4be2-a6b1-ddd8639e83d9/).html)  


I am originally from Beijing, but I am tired of the life in big city. That is the reason I live in Denmark now.

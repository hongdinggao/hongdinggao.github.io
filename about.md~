I am a postdoc in Animal breeding and genetics and focus on statistical methods of genetic evaluation and genomic selection,
I love trying different ideas on my computer, previously, I am an industrial postdoc from  

-  Aarhus University [AU](http://www.au.dk/en/)    
-  Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation [NAV](http://www.nordicebv.info)  

I mainly work on genetic evaluation and genomic selection in dairy cattle.

I am originally from Beijing. I am tired of life in big city. Currently, I live in a small town in Denmark.

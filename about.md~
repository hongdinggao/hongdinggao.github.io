Hi! I am Hongding Gao, Postdoc in molecular biology and genetics, and focus on statistical methods of genetic evaluation and genomic selection.
I love trying ideas on my computer. 

Previously, I am an industrial postdoc from   
-  Aarhus University [AU](http://www.au.dk/en/)    
-  Nordic Cattle Genetic Evaluation [NAV](http://www.nordicebv.info)  

I have a PhD degree in quantitative genetics, I mainly work on genetic evaluation and genomic prediction in dairy cattle.
You can down load my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/hongding.pdf)


I am originally from Beijing. I am pretty tired of life in big city. Currently, I live in a small town in Denmark.

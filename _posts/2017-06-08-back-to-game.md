It's been exactly 2 years since the last update of this website, the main reason is due to my laziness.
Anyway, I decide to be back to the game and push myself to record something randomly and continually.
During the last couple of years, 2 main things happen in my life  

-  My son: Gordon has arrived and he is close to 3 month now
-  My 3 years industrial postdoc project was finished, it was my 1st research funding  

Life is not that bad for me and I appreciate every morning. At the moment, I spend all my spare
time with my family especially with my son. He is an pretty active guy and seems like super happy
everyday, I hope he would have a wonderful childhood.

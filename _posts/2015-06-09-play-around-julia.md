Lately, I start playing with Julia which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.

Meanwhile, I found [the nice blog](http://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html), it clearly illustrates the basic ideas of scientific computing.

The basic workflow for scientific computing should be:

1.  Make it work  
2.  Make it fast  

As mentioned in that blog, I have the similar habit for my daily work:

>  Normally I use one language to make something work, and a second language to make it fast, and a third 
>  language to make it scream.  

Personlly, I like using **R** to test my algorithm, once the code works, I recode it using **Fortran** or **C**. Sometimes, it's a bit time-consuming to travelling back and forth between different programming languages. Luckly, here comes the **Julia**, I think it is a promising language and it deserves to be learned.

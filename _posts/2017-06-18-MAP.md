I am sure every people uses map in their daily life. Map helps people find their target location, 
generally speaking, map links people from one lacation to another. 

In programming, especially in my field, map is more than crucial. I guess most of the popular languages have map class, 
such as C++ and Java. Thanks to map, it helped me a lot in my projects, I use it mostly for all the housekeeping coding 
in my program,  so I dicide to mark a little bit here.
 
The map class in C++ is very handy, it avoids writing hash table by myself which is a headache stuff I think.  
Some languages use dictionary to achieve the same functionality such as Python, Julia, .Net. In Javascript, PHP and AWK, its name 
is associative array. To my knowledge, they are almost mean the same thing.

I am sure every people uses map in their daily life. map is a tool help people to find the target location, 
more generally speaking, map links people from one lacation to another. 

In programming, map is also crucial, almoste all the popular languages have map class, such as C++ and Java. 
Thanks to map, it helped me a lot in my projects so I dicide to mark a little bit here.
 
The map class in C++ is very handy, it avoids writing hash table by myself which is a headache stuff, I think. 
Some languages use dictionary to achieve the same functionality such as Python, Julia, .Net. In Javascript, PHP and AWK, its name 
is associative array. To my knowledge, they are almost mean the same thing.
